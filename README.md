## My Coding Goals
- Try to code everyday
- Slowly ramp up the level of my projects
- Gain a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, React, and PHP
- Learn to have cleaner DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) code
- Not be afraid to make mistakes and dabble in unknown areas (NOT looking for perfection)
- Make interesting projects and have fun!
